Fiscal policy
-------------
we can afford whatever we can actually achieve 

what we choose to achieve is the political goal - it is not correct to say "we cannot afford that". it's "we choose to spend money on something else".  then the arguments became real.  see how most budget negotiations occur in most large corps - they start nice and "high faulting goals" and turn into "don't give mary 5 million to build that, it's a shit idea give me 3 and barry two for our better ideas"

which leads to

- democracy in organisations


index linked salaries hold down inflation? see belgium 

also if money is just a score then the current distribution is political - so mass debt forgiveness becomes easier when one guy rules but is it a bad idea? if debt is only way for many people to keep up - why not? build debt that is valuable ? 

Peak Globalisation 
------------------

It used to be a US startup would source (handbags) from a chinese manufacturer and sell on Amazon - two middle men.  Now there are chinese apps seeing direct from manufacturer (temu) - but noticeably these goods cost same in USA as they do to have delivered in Morocco or Turkey.  The point is that trade and globalisation has reached point where only failing states are "cheaper" 

Not sure what it means - discuss earlier globalisation via Gengis Khan or Ice and 1850s (Frederic Tudor / Lake Wenham) 

Edication
---------
- education at students pace - you don't have lesson on changing gear then move on 

Citizenship
-----------

- citizen ship testing?

Climate change
--------------
Managing the end of growth in multiple cities across the world - look at Miami or phoenix.

The great displacement - climate chnage and next american migration

Handling refugees is one thing - handling internal refugees might make that easier ? 


Sweep of history
----------------
urbanisation - it's less deadly when things go wrong. social safety net, even where there is not one by government 

city states to nation states 
are we seeing mega-nation states? 

urban planning
--------------

Walkable city

urban design - every child can walk or cycle to school on car free paths


different roads for different vehicles (a bike is a vehicle and benefits from seperate roads.  Basically divide based on vulnerability. also note driverless cars will probably need their own walled off roads (destroying most busines models)

this will have to lead to a lot of multi lane roads and or lots of park and ride intersections and or just making most cities non car friendly (but delivery vehicle friendly)

also see barcelona - zones

also strong towns

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9623863/IMFs-epic-plan-to-conjure-away-debt-and-dethrone-bankers.html

If we all have crypto and we can see each indovidual coin moving then by default if I transfer my coins to a bank and then Insee them go off to some risky investment I am going to want them back - they should be in my account - and if I just get a "trust me" I think Sam bankman fried - and I may as well keep the money in my phone wallet.  

at this point yeah fractional reserve is dead - 100% is what we get and states have full control over the growth of money supply - lenidong willmoccur privately but ... money growth will be state controlled ... might not be what we want but how do we avoid ?
