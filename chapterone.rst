Fiscal policy
-------------
we can afford whatever we can actually achieve 

what we choose to achieve is the political goal - it is not correct to say "we cannot afford that". it's "we choose to spend money on something else".  then the arguments became real.  see how most budget negotiations occur in most large corps - they start nice and "high faulting goals" and turn into "don't give mary 5 million to build that, it's a shit idea give me 3 and barry two for our better ideas"

which leads to

- democracy in organisations


index linked salaries hold down inflation? see belgium 

also if money is just a score then the current distribution is political - so mass debt forgiveness becomes easier when one guy rules but is it a bad idea? if debt is only way for many people to keep up - why not? build debt that is valuable ? 

therapy
--------

culture war is just politics not worse politics

how we decide how we decide is politics as much as how and what we decide - people who are neurotic diverse are an example of how we decide - the "farmer goes to kill the pig because " - 

deepening democracy is human centred, learning how to handle autistic child - a crowd 

Housing 
-------
Planning acts -> tendency to build on large sites outside of town to just make it simpler - which drives the strong town problem 

why cannot local authorities do the work of risk and parcelling up and then aiming to do smaller dense builds inside current infrastructure? 


Science - social learning 
- we see pandemic and the plan for experiments on bus is fast learning software enhanced learning and sensible defaults - plus no one owned it so no one complained


sensible defaults - paternislma nd libertarian 

Social is only way forward - openly shared, sensible defaults plus politics to 

shaping operations to be in our favour.

We got there and Japan copied *everything* because was not clear what was the essential- still not and that's what this books tries to discuss - what is essential, what parts do we super charge with software and what parts are optional 


Don't wait for it to be obvious before shaping - look at hollywood VFX - software adjacent field - and the need for better sharing revenue model and unionisation 

steven minuchin did basically QE - but did it better than usual QE mechanism - it's political choice to give money to banks who aren't really private 

Peak Globalisation 
------------------

It used to be a US startup would source (handbags) from a chinese manufacturer and sell on Amazon - two middle men.  Now there are chinese apps seeing direct from manufacturer (temu) - but noticeably these goods cost same in USA as they do to have delivered in Morocco or Turkey.  The point is that trade and globalisation has reached point where only failing states are "cheaper" 

Not sure what it means - discuss earlier globalisation via Gengis Khan or Ice and 1850s (Frederic Tudor / Lake Wenham) 

Edication
---------
- education at students pace - you don't have lesson on changing gear then move on 

Citizenship
-----------

- citizen ship testing?

Climate change
--------------
Managing the end of growth in multiple cities across the world - look at Miami or phoenix.

The great displacement - climate chnage and next american migration

Handling refugees is one thing - handling internal refugees might make that easier ? 


Sweep of history
----------------
urbanisation - it's less deadly when things go wrong. social safety net, even where there is not one by government 

city states to nation states 
are we seeing mega-nation states? 

urban planning
--------------

Walkable city

urban design - every child can walk or cycle to school on car free paths


different roads for different vehicles (a bike is a vehicle and benefits from seperate roads.  Basically divide based on vulnerability. also note driverless cars will probably need their own walled off roads (destroying most busines models)

this will have to lead to a lot of multi lane roads and or lots of park and ride intersections and or just making most cities non car friendly (but delivery vehicle friendly)

also see barcelona - zones

also strong towns

Measure value per acre - basically provide mixed use commercial environments

Low use cars
-------------
High carbon initial cost of evs os such that for cars that have very low usage (??) then replacing the car will not have a positive return on carbon reduction - so have some licensing scheme for low usage cars till end of life - why spend 100 tons of CO2 for a car that is going to sit in garage most of its life and output 50 tons ?

Banking
-------
heading for the chicago plan anyhow - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_plan

the emergence of fiat crypto will end fractional reserve and need something else

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9623863/IMFs-epic-plan-to-conjure-away-debt-and-dethrone-bankers.html

If we all have crypto and we can see each indovidual coin moving then by default if I transfer my coins to a bank and then Insee them go off to some risky investment I am going to want them back - they should be in my account - and if I just get a "trust me" I think Sam bankman fried - and I may as well keep the money in my phone wallet.  

at this point yeah fractional reserve is dead - 100% is what we get and states have full control over the growth of money supply - lenidong willmoccur privately but ... money growth will be state controlled ... might not be what we want but how do we avoid ?
