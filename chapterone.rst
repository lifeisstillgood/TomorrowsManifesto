If we all have crypto and we can see each indovidual coin moving then by default if I transfer my coins to a bank and then Insee them go off to some risky investment I am going to want them back - they should be in my account - and if I just get a "trust me" I think Sam bankman fried - and I may as well keep the money in my phone wallet.  

at this point yeah fractional reserve is dead - 100% is what we get and states have full control over the growth of money supply - lenidong willmoccur privately but ... money growth will be state controlled ... might not be what we want but how do we avoid ?
